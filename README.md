## Features

- ScreenClean hides all your content from your screen so you can clean your Mac display without distractions.
- Lock your complete keyboard with a single button press so you can clean it without pressing random keys, skipping to the next song or activating Siri.
- Enable **autostart mode** to lock the keyboard immediately after opening the app.
